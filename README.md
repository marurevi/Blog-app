# Blog app

## Description

> The Blog app will be a classic example of a blog website. You will create a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

### How to build the Blog app

> The end result should follow the following data model (this is an Entity Relationship Diagram that you are already familiar with):

</p>

For this project you will have full freedom in terms of visual design but you will need to keep the following wireframes:

</p>

> You will be guided step by step, and because of that you will have a chance to practice your knowledge about basic Ruby on Rails concepts - starting from the Views and finishing the database connection. You will also implement ideas like authentication, authorization, and all kinds of tests. In the last step, you will have a chance to create an API instead of API consumption.
